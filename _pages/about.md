My name is De Xie (谢德). I am now a Ph.D. student at Department of Electronic Engineering, [Xidian University](http://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My advisor is Prof. [Cheng Deng](http://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/chdeng/). My research interest lies in computer vision, natural language processing and multi-modal analysis.

I completed my Master's degrees from [Xidian University](http://www.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2019. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology](http://www.xauat.edu.cn/zh-cn/index.php) in 2015.
